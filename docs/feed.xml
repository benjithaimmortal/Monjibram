Wait, you didn’t tell me… how much are you… ? Oh yeah, it doesn’t matter, if it isn’t free, it’s too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter your hosting fee here, then click the button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; class=&quot;doesnt-matter&quot; /&gt;
&lt;button onclick=&quot;alert('Too much :(')&quot;&gt;How much?&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s got to be a catch, you say. I get what I pay for. I’m going to drop quality somewhere. Maybe I won’t get a custom url? Maybe I have to choose from a gaudy design template, or worse, use a clunky website editor like it’s 2005 and I’m building a MySpace profile. Is it going to be slow? It’ll probably be really slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, my friend, this is 2020 and computers work for you. Well, at least they will, if you step outside of the cookie cutter Wix profile that your competitor is paying up to $500 a month for &lt;em&gt;for the rest of their meager existence&lt;/em&gt;. This is the year of STATIC SITES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Static Site&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A website that doesn’t need to send data back and forth to your browser to provide its content [browser-based]&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A website that can connect to everything without a server [serverless]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-history&quot;&gt;Some History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, static sites have been around since the 1990’s. Back before every page needed login credentials, when the internet was a small place with anonymous pages, many of those pages were static. They were quick, available to everyone, and resource-cheap. That’s the definition of a marketing site!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benji</name></author><summary type="html">I’m here to tell you that you’re paying too much to host your marketing website.

&lt;p&gt;That’s a question I often ask myself when it’s late at night and I am hacking away, retooling a data integration on someone’s personal site. But it’s also a question that you might want the answer for, if you’re somewhere on the path to a career change in software development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benji</name></author><summary type="html">How did I get myself into this?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TIL: AJAX for WordPress</title><link href="/monjiredes/blog/blobs" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TIL: AJAX for WordPress" /><published>2020-05-16T08:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-16T08:06:00-04:00</updated><id>/monjiredes/blog/blobs</id><content type="html" xml:base="/monjiredes/blog/blobs">&lt;p&gt;Pressin’ those words with WordPress…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benji</name></author><summary type="html">Pressin’ those words with WordPress…</summary></entry></feed>
