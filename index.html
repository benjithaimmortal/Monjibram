<h1 class='title-bit'>Hi. I'm Benji.</h1>
<br>
<p>
  I'm a front-end developer at <a href="https://builtbytophat.com"><strong>Top Hat</strong></a>, Pittsburgh's award-winning, boutique web marketing firm. I'm a community volunteer, public speaker, touring cyclist, squash captain, and father. When I'm not running away from Internet Explorer support requests, I keep busy making beautiful things on computers. I am inspired by my faith, and the fact that every challenge I encounter [on modern web browsers] is fun to overcome.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I'm also a public speaker and advocate for Jamstack, the modern, faster, cheaper method for marketing and personal sites. I love <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/' target="_blank">Jekyll</a> because it's old school, but I've worked in almost everything from Flask to Pellican to Gatsby to Eleventy to Nuxt. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts about WordPress:</p>
<ul style="margin: 20px 0 0 30px;">
  <li><a href='{% link _posts/0000-00-00-wordpress-is-a-framework.md %}'>It's capable of anything</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☜ Blog</li>
  <li><a href='{% link _posts/2020-05-16-jam-that-sucker.md %}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>It isn't for everything</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☜ Blog</li>
  <li><a href='https://wppittsburgh.com/headless-wordpress-on-vue-and-nuxt/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>It can be fast if you try hard</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☜ Video Tutorial</li>
  <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGdYVslWJdQ&t=15m6s' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>But Jamstack is easy!</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☜ Lightning Talk</li>
</ul>

  My work is featured on many sites, including <a href='https://www.drsarchitects.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><strong>DRS Architects</strong></a>, <a href='https://www.reubensbrews.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><strong>Reuben's Brews</strong></a>, <a href='https://www.revtownusa.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><strong>Revtown Jeans</strong></a>, and <a href='https://www.snake.dev' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><strong>Snakedev</strong></a>. My work is also featured at <a href='https://sdglobal.modoo.at' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><strong>Seongdong Global Experience Center</strong></a> in the <a href='https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/201811151679724140' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><strong>City of Seoul, South Korea</strong></a>, but that's another story for another day.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I'm currently working on some secret things, as well as a site for the Mattress Factory (a contemporary art museum), a front-end for the Pittsburgh Python User Group, and an <em>HTML video game</em>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I'm always up for a challenge. <br><a href='{% link contact.html %}'>Contact me today!</a>
