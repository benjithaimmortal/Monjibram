<h1>Hi. I'm Benji.</h1>

<p>
  I'm a front-end developer at <a href="https://builtbytophat.com"><strong>Top Hat</strong></a>, Pittsburgh's award-winning, boutique web marketing firm. I'm a community volunteer, public speaker, touring cyclist, squash captain, and father. When I'm not running away from Internet Explorer support requests, I keep busy making beautiful things on computers. I am inspired by my faith, and the fact that every challenge I encounter [on modern web browsers] is fun to overcome.
