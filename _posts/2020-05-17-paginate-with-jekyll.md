I used `paginate: 5` and 
`paginate_path: "/blog/:num/"`

I also learned that `index.html` becomes the slash on whatever its root. For example, `blog/index.html` is happily routed as `/blog/`!

oh dear, and this https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2014/11/05/adding-ajax-pagination-to-jekyll.html

The End.
