<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">--</span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I&nbsp;want to start off by noting two things.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;I chose this topic based on&nbsp;something my father&nbsp;read about on a Christian newsletter.&nbsp; It's necessary to say that even if someone <em>does</em>&nbsp;know Hebrew&nbsp;they&nbsp;are not&nbsp;always&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;an accurate translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, our limited resources&nbsp;allow for a lot of ambiguity&nbsp; and&nbsp;conclusions should not be drawn at all (though I think that this is not one of those cases.)&nbsp; Second, this article&nbsp;may contain a limited amount of research and technical material, but I&nbsp;hope to use language&nbsp;that is&nbsp;simple enough for&nbsp;everyone to understand.&nbsp; There's no reason to cloud up a relatively easy case of word-use.</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Now the article I've been asked to&nbsp;critique&nbsp;seems to think that YHWH's 'hardening' of Pharaoh's heart implies a removal of emotional facades -essentially a 'wringing out' of a person's true nature.&nbsp; This differs slightly&nbsp;from the modern understanding of a hard heart, which&nbsp;is basically&nbsp;stubbornness.&nbsp; I propose that someone who has a hard heart does not allow circumstances, no matter how difficult or severe, to change his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardened heart&nbsp;doesn't unearth any special insight into the nature of the individual, beyond his own stance on&nbsp;whatever issue is being discussed.&nbsp; <em>For instance:</em> Pharaoh's mind was already made up about letting the Israelites out of Egypt, hence his hardened heart did not allow the plagues to change him.&nbsp; His nature aside, Pharaoh's <em>mind</em> was not changed by the plagues.</span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">PART I: LANGUAGE</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In order to reach either conclusion, every available instance that the phrase "harden heart"&nbsp;is used must be considered.&nbsp; Luckily, a few geniuses (some from Oxford, of course) already did most of&nbsp;this... for <em>every word in the Hebrew Bible</em>.&nbsp; The </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brown-Driver-Briggs-Hebrew-English-Lexicon-Francis/dp/1565632060?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=widgetsamazon-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon</a>&nbsp;attempts to cite and define&nbsp;everything in the book, down to&nbsp;<em>every single attested&nbsp;verb</em>.&nbsp; The published edition of the BDB does not reference every time common words (such as&nbsp;דבר "to speak") occur, but it does&nbsp;mention&nbsp;a&nbsp;good&nbsp;number of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also&nbsp;mentions&nbsp;<em>every </em>occurence of the&nbsp;less-used verbs.
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">[Without going in depth or too off-topic, we need to briefly discuss one of the hardest parts of&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Biblical-Hebrew-Thomas-Lambdin/dp/0023672501?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=widgetsamazon-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">learning Hebrew</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=widgetsamazon-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=0023672501" height="1" style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px !important; padding-left: 0px !important; padding-right: 0px !important; padding-top: 0px !important;" width="1" /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">.&nbsp; Hebrew</span> is made up of different verb 'stems' that mean different things.&nbsp; When the normal (pa'al) verb can be 'active', there&nbsp;are also 'passive'&nbsp;(niph'al), 'causative' (hiph'il), 'reflexive' (hitpa''el)&nbsp;and even 'passive-causative' (hoph'al) stems of the same root!&nbsp; The plant analogy should make this easy to remember: every root can have a lot of stems.&nbsp; Of course this is&nbsp;much&nbsp;more&nbsp;complex, but&nbsp;I can't describe that&nbsp;here.]</span>
<span style="background-color: #999999;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In this particular&nbsp;case,&nbsp;חזק is a&nbsp;pretty common&nbsp;verb in the&nbsp;active (pa'al)&nbsp;verb stem meaning "to be strong", in the causative (hiph'il) stem meaning "to make strong" and in&nbsp;a secondary active&nbsp;stem (we call it the pi''el) meaning "to be/make strong".&nbsp; I say that the pi''el is a secondary stem, but really we don't know exactly how to describe it in relation to the rest.&nbsp; Sometimes it <em>is</em> a tricky stem to identify, but here it can't have a meaning far from the first one.&nbsp; Note that YHWH says "<em>I will harden</em> (hiph'il) Pharaoh's heart" (Exodus 7:3) and the result is "Pharaoh's heart <em>became hard </em>(pi''el)" (Exodus 7:13)&nbsp; The text is using a very common tactic to demonstrate that [exactly what God says] = [exactly what happens], and there should be no mincing of definitions.</span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Some&nbsp;ways to argue for a&nbsp;difficult verb meaning (note that none of these are used in this case):</em></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Author's intent (there are different authors in the Bible and each has his own underlying motive)</em></span></li>
<li><em><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: x-small;">Story's content (each story has a lot going on, and you can usually piece together the odd&nbsp;reference from context)</span></em></li>
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Special&nbsp;uses vs. the general use of the verb (some verbs have multiple meanings)</em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Special cases (mistakes, errors, uncommon words, etc.)</em></span></li>
<li><em><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: x-small;">Word order indicates an unusual pattern or meaning (including alliteration)</span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: x-small;">"They talk funny up north" (A.K.A.&nbsp;the Rendsburg argument) OR the verb's meaning has changed over time</span></em></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">This is where, if I were writing a research paper, I would fill in a few pages of data.&nbsp; (These are all the times this verb is used in this stem; This is the subtle nuance that makes this phrase unique among all other ways to communicate this meaning.)&nbsp; This&nbsp;is unnecessary.&nbsp; The root is common.&nbsp; The context indicates that there is no special or inferred&nbsp;meaning.&nbsp; The phrase&nbsp;is the most common way to indicate a person's strength of intention.&nbsp; There is nothing unusual about the word order or the grammar.</span>
<span style="background-color: #999999;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Because the phrase looks very straightforward, let's just take a short-cut and look in the BDB.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;">Sure enough, the verb has to do with hardening or strengthening, not wringing or tightening.&nbsp; It is used in situations where someone or something&nbsp;will be&nbsp;brought against a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;(good or bad).&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning is pretty secure.&nbsp; There are plenty&nbsp;of other cases that suggest this verb simply means "strengthen",&nbsp;and there is no indication that it means anything else&nbsp;(for other examples of a pi''el of this verb, see Psalm 147:13, Nehemiah 6:9, Nahum 3:14, etc.)</span>
<span style="background-color: #999999;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">PART II: THEOLOGY</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">So <em>why</em> does God choose to make up Pharaoh's mind?&nbsp; This is where the ambiguity sets in.&nbsp; If I were giving a sermon on the passage, my answer would probably reflect God's inherent tendency to&nbsp;remedy&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;problems with one solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt is going to&nbsp;oppress Israel &gt;&gt; Egypt gets oppressed.&nbsp; Israelites don't immediately trust&nbsp;God &gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israelites don't get to&nbsp;immediately leave&nbsp;their slavery.</span>
<span style="background-color: #999999;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Let's ignore for now the larger questions about predestination.&nbsp; I have yet to completely work this out, but right now it seems likely that God did know exactly what was going to happen, and he found that Israel's position here would create the best possible outcome in the future.&nbsp; Let's imagine that we're on a train, and we have the choice to flip a switch onto another track.&nbsp; One track leads over a rickety bridge that extends halfway across a cliff, the other one goes round-about but makes it all the way to the other side.&nbsp; I imagine that an omnicient God would have a much more complicated version of this going on in His head every time He makes a decision.&nbsp; He knows what to do to get the best result for everyone, and that's why He does what He does.</span>
<span style="background-color: #999999;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Therefore, we can answer simply that we don't know <em>for</em> <em>what reason</em>&nbsp;God hardened Pharaoh's heart.&nbsp; It could have been in response to Pharaoh's own acts, or to the acts of the Israelites, or even to make the perfect backdrop for today.&nbsp; Let's not try to out-think an immortal.</span>
<span style="background-color: #999999;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">PART III: THINGS THAT LOOK STRANGE TO ME</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I want to list a few things that I&nbsp;think are even more odd than God's action in this passage:</span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">"Uncircumsized lips."&nbsp; What the crap is that?&nbsp; Unlike&nbsp;"hardened heart" this phrase does not occur very often.&nbsp; Most translations try to link&nbsp;the connotations&nbsp;to a stutter or problem&nbsp;with public speaking, but this is&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;a reference to a foreign dialect that was unknown to the Pharaoh.&nbsp; After all, Moses was living with Midianites for a while!&nbsp; It wouldn't be strange for him to adopt their slang.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Moses' position to Pharaoh.&nbsp; Moses asks for help because of his language issues (see above) and YHWH instructs&nbsp;Moses' brother Aaron to help him do the talking.&nbsp; At this point YHWH explains that Moses will be "like God to Pharaoh" (not speaking with him directly?) and Aaron will be his "prophet"!&nbsp; That's an interesting simile, and it gives a huge amount of insight to the author's theological perspective.&nbsp; The Hebrew Bible rarely&nbsp;gives a <em>direct </em>exposition of doctrine like this!&nbsp; I won't say any more, in case I return to this topic in the future.</span></li>
</ol>
