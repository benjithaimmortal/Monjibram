I'm here to tell you that you're paying too much to host your marketing website. Wait, you didn't tell me... how much are you... ? Oh yeah, it doesn't matter, if it isn't free, it's too much.

**Enter your hosting fee here, then click the button**

<input type="number" class='doesnt-matter'>
<button onclick="alert('Too much :(')">How much?</button>

There's got to be a catch, you say. I get what I pay for. I'm going to drop quality somewhere. Maybe I won't get a custom url? Maybe I have to choose from a gaudy design template, or worse, use a clunky website editor like it's 2005 and I'm building a MySpace profile. Is it going to be slow? It'll probably be really slow.

No, my friend, this is 2020 and computers work for you. Well, at least they will, if you step outside of the cookie cutter Wix profile that your competitor is paying up to $500 a month for *for the rest of their meager existence*. This is the year of STATIC SITES.

Static Site
: A website that doesn't need to send data back and forth to your browser to provide its content [browser-based]
: A website that can connect to everything without a server [serverless]



## Some History
Actually, static sites have been around since the 1990's. Back before every page needed login credentials, when the internet was a small place with anonymous pages, many of those pages were static. They were quick, available to everyone, and resource-cheap. That's the definition of a marketing site!
