I'm here to tell you that you're paying too much to host your marketing website. Wait, you didn't tell me... how much are you... ? Oh yeah, it doesn't matter, if it isn't free, it's too much.

**Enter your hosting fee here, then click the button**

$<input type="number" class='doesnt-matter' placeholder=40 style="padding: 5px 0;">
<button onclick="alert('Too much :(')" style="padding: 5px; border: none; background: #d8acb2;">How much?</button>

There's got to be a catch, you say. I get what I pay for. I'm going to drop quality somewhere. Maybe I won't get a custom url? Maybe I have to choose from a gaudy design template, or worse, use a clunky website editor like it's 2005 and I'm building a MySpace profile. Is it going to be slow? It'll probably be really slow.

No, my friend, this is 2020 and computers work for you. Well, at least they will, if you step outside of the cookie cutter Wix profile that your competitor is paying up to $500 a month for *for the rest of their meager existence*. This is the year of STATIC SITES.

Static Site
: A website that doesn't need to send data back and forth to your browser to provide its content [browser-based]
: A website that can connect to everything without a server [serverless]



## Some History
Actually, static sites have been around since the 1990's. Back before every page needed login credentials, when the internet was a small place with anonymous pages, many of those pages were static. They were quick, available to everyone, and resource-cheap. That's the definition of a marketing site!

So why isn't everything static? Your own technical experience, for starters. Early static sites needed experience with HTML at a bare minimum. Adding assets like audio, images, and video dynamically, and templating the results, was a big ask. A graphical interface for uploading media? Forget it.

Today we've got [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) bringing the heat without the cost of a fire. These give you the freedom to use good-looking interfaces and a Google Docs-style text editor, and their base plans are free!

## You Don't Need to Log In

You're not making Facebook 3.0. You're not asking for a number-munching Site as a Service. You're just trying to get visibility. Any dynamic experience you need to give your customers could come from a simple cookie.

## E-Commerce is Easy

This miiiight blow your mind, but there is a little thing called an API that does all the heavy lifting in modern websites. That includes eCommerce. There is no reason to set up your products on a service like Shopify or SnipCart, then set them up again inside of your own site.
