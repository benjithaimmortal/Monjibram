I'll also share real-world examples that take an initial set of requirements for hiring through every stage of the process, from writing a hiring plan and job posting to making decisions after finalist interviews. Throughout, I'll focus on producing reusable materials that will make your initial hiring process more successful and allow you to learn from and iterate on your process in subsequent searches.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n* An approach for developing a hiring strategy\r\n* Writing effective job postings\r\n* Turning a hiring strategy into screening/interview questions\r\n* Developing rubrics to consistently score applicants\r\n* How to iteratively evaluate your hiring processes","tags":"hiring, management","level":"Beginner","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:24.895Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:24.895Z","presenter":{"name":"Marisa Brandt"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/24.json"},{"id":25,"title":"The EM Kata","body":"Kata is the Japanese word for form.

What responsibility do we have as a software industry to create ethical software that contributes to human flourishing?  \r\nIn this talk, we assume that many negative outcomes in software have come from well meaning developers, who either didn’t stop to ask the right questions, or didn’t know how to vocalize their concerns.  In this talk, we will examine ethical failures in software systems, and we will observe different categories of these failures.  From each category, we will derive questions that developers can ask to avoid this committing this category of ethical error. \r\nFrom these categories, we will consider three questions that developers should ask themselves to ensure that they are not writing software that is unethical.  \r\nFirst, we will consider the ethical implications of respecting the humanity of your users.  Is it ethical to create systems without considering all the users of the system, not just those who are demographically similar to the development team?  What would it mean to live in a world where every piece of software was designed to respect the humanity of ALL its users?  \r\nSecond, we will consider the ethical implications of the amplifying power of software systems, and what role developers play in amplifying behavior across society.   What would it look like to live in a society where care was taken to amplify the best of humanity, and not just the parts that resulted in the most “engagement”?\r\nFinally, we will consider the role of ethics in quality.  What would a software developers’ “hippocratic oath” look like?  What would it be like to live in a world where software was developed with quality standards that every developer strived to “do no harm”.\r\n\r\nFor each of these questions, in addition to giving developers a series of questions to ask themselves, and a language for expressing ethical concerns, we will also look at solutions that are being developed in these areas, for example GenderMag (http://gendermag.org/) which helps developers overcome gender bias in software, or the latest in algorithmic fairness. \r\n\r\nI look forward to giving this talk, and working towards a world where ethical software is being developed everyday, where users’ humanity is respected by software, where the best of humanity is amplified, and all developers are working to do no harm.  I believe such a world is possible, and that software can be a force for good in the world.\r\n","tags":"ethics, software developement","level":"Beginner","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:24.936Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:24.936Z","presenter":{"name":"Michael Hilton"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/27.json"},{"id":28,"title":"A Better Approach to Observability","body":"Do you measure and monitor your applications by alerting on metrics like CPU, memory usage, and request latency?

From high-pressure whiteboard coding that feels more like a Broadway audition, to reciting encyclopedic knowledge found in computer science textbooks, it is no secret that technical interviews are broken. While these practices are well-known and have significant debate surrounding their accuracy and efficacy, the hidden and deleterious effects they have on tech workers have gone unrecognized.\r\n \r\nUnnecessarily difficult technical interviews can create imposter syndrome which can cause new mental health issues, exacerbate existing ones. Long-term, this can affect productivity, morale, retention and drive people to abandon their tech careers or even halt tech careers before they’ve begun. With sites like OSMI Forums, Burnout.io and many others, tech workers are increasingly speaking out about mental health issues. While companies seek to uncover the source of these issues, they often ignore a very basic component; the technical interview.\r\n \r\nAs evidenced by the existence of They Whiteboarded Me (they.whiteboarded.me) and Hiring Without Whiteboards (github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) there is substantial frustration around these interviewing techniques. This talk aims to unpack and discuss the intersection between mental health, job hunting and technical interviews.

Instead, engineers should focus on the holistic aspects of working effectively while solo and in teams. In this talk, i’ll cover the “other” skills engineers need, and how to grow them.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to get ahead in your career or just improve as an engineer, time and time again people think the only solution is to either step into the management track, or double down and engineer as hard as they can. If only they can bang out slightly better code, they’ll be that better engineer.\r\n\r\nBut this a myopic and frankly incompatible approach with the realities of engineering in many companies. “The engineer in the corner” is not who you should aspire to be, and increasingly the opportunity to be such an engineer is disappearing. Even in the biggest companies, the lone wolf is a dying breed.\r\n\r\nInstead, engineers should focus on what have incorrectly been labeled as “soft skills”, when in fact it’s really amongst the hardest things to be good at for almost all of us. Communication. Empathy. Collaboration. Problem Solving (and not just at the code level). Responsibility.\r\n\r\nThese are among the topics I will speak on from my 15+ years of industry experience, working in small and large companies, cross functionally across many different roles.

Kevin often visits companies, where he hears about how they struggle to break up monolithic applications or move to a continuous deployment pipeline. Oftentimes, the organizational structure is clearly making their problems harder but is seen as something that can’t be changed. Kevin relates his own journey to a more experimental organizational style. As a developer at Microsoft, Kevin worked in a rigid hierarchy organized around functional areas. The communication flows within the organization dictated the way it structured its libraries and dependencies. This is the essence of Conway’s law. In this case, the company hierarchy and the architecture it produced was often suboptimal for the problem Kevin and his team were solving, but it was the architectural path of least resistance. When Kevin moved to Adobe and became a senior manager, he started to build his organization in the traditional way. Adobe wanted to create a more fluid and agile architecture for its products, but the company struggled to realize these goals because it was it was too hard to work across teams and reporting lines. The company finally started to make some progress as the organization became more fluid and loosely coupled. Kevin then went to Spotify, which had realized this problem early on and restructured its organization in a way that supported the architectural model that it wanted to build. As a vice president of engineering, Kevin was able to see firsthand how the organizational model simplified the architectural challenges that other companies struggled with while also introducing difficulties that other companies were easily able to overcome. When Kevin joined Avvo as its CTO, the company had the same organization and architectural challenges as many other startups, but rather than attack them only from an architectural angle, Avvo experimented with architecture and organization together to improve its legacy systems and help build new ones faster and with higher quality.","tags":"software architecture, organization design, culture","level":"Beginner","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:25.862Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:25.862Z","presenter":{"name":"Kevin Goldsmith"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/92.json"},{"id":93,"title":"All!

This multi-platform focus makes the testing effort to be at least twice as complicated as when a simple web application is targeted.\r\n\r\nWith the growing market around smartphones, developers needed more ways to ensure software quality of their product. This need is why many mobile UI test frameworks have been introduced. With the most significant share of the mobile market being taken by Android OS, development and testing efforts have been especially crucial in this ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAmong the variety of Mobile UI automation tools, two frameworks have been especially notable: Robotium and Appium. However, with more organizations moving towards multi-platform solutions, those of us, who used Robotium, are slowly moving towards Appium. This journey from Robotium to Appium is where the main focus of this presentation lies.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we deep dive into both Robotium and Appium. We discuss why and how to transition from Robotium to Appium in the Android ecosystem. Lastly, we look at common mistakes made during this transition, and how to avoid them.\r\n","tags":"mobile,testing","level":"Advanced","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:25.943Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:25.943Z","presenter":{"name":"Dmitry Vinnik"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/97.json"},{"id":98,"title":"The White Glove Treatment: Polishing Your iOS Build with Jenkins","body":"We use continuous integration and delivery systems to help us build apps all the time.

That’s why we invented design patterns. Design patterns abstract common approaches to problem solving into generic approaches that can be modified to suit the application at hand.\r\n\r\nMany of the design patterns in common use today are inspired by static object-oriented Enterprise languages like Java and C++. These languages have a feature set that is somewhat more restrictive than the languages that came after them, and many design patterns are built to provide elegant ways around these restrictions.\r\n\r\nDesign patterns, like Dependency Injection, and the Singleton pattern arise from restrictions on how you can pass code around at runtime. The Visitor Pattern arose from a need to safely traverse data structures. Other patterns, like Iterators and Factories, have been replaced by first-class language features of their own.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll build up several design patterns, and then look at features in newer languages, and newer versions of languages that make each pattern unnecessary. In doing so, you’ll get a view into idiomatically designing code in your favourite language, and a greater understanding of design decisions users of other languages need to make.\r\n","tags":"python, kotlin, java, design patterns, patterns, object-oriented programming, programming, architecture","level":"Advanced","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:25.987Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:25.987Z","presenter":{"name":"Christopher Neugebauer"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/100.json"},{"id":101,"title":"MUD to OOP: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Online RPGs","body":"Text-based online multi-user dungeons, or “MUDs” have been around since the 1980s, and are still popular in 2019.

Software development practices have matured over the last 30 years, to include all forms of testing to verify software quality. In the last ten years, there has been a huge spike in the adoption of automated tests, effectively replacing some of these manual testing practices, and supplementing many traditional testing activities. Many parts of the software development industry, however, are wary of replacing manual testing with automated testing. Not only is there often a lack of confidence in the automation tests, many see automated testing as fragile, unmaintainable, and ultimately, something delivering a low return on investment. Max believes that by employing mature software development techniques, we can achieve robust, maintainable, tests, that deliver confidence of the application under test. In addition to discussing how to structure automated tests that are cleaner, more maintainable and efficient, developer testing, and deployment techniques can be used to programmatically verify test correctness.

While I can't tell you what percentage of your time should be spent on bugs vs. new things, I can give you an understanding of what this space looks like at scale: direct from the owner of the customer feedback process at GitHub.\r\n\r\nWith examples coming from a well-known product like GitHub, my hope is that the audience will be able to draw parallels to their own experiences regardless of the size of their project. We will talk about things that have gone well and things that have not and the lessons we learned from it over the last 5 years at GitHub. We will take a deep dive into what happens when you don't do a good job of listening to customers and compare that to the behaviors of a project that has become customer obsessed. \r\n\r\nFinally, we've been through a lot of iterations of how best to handle customer feedback. We'll talk about the things you can do on the cheap and the type of stuff that makes sense at larger scale (aka, it'll cost ya). We'll also talk about the ideal state, which includes some thoughts and opportunities that currently sound good on paper but haven't been tested in our own crucible of enterprise and open source experience. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to give you all some ideas of how to handle feedback for your own project or projects while giving you a little reassurance that it's OK to not totally nail this area. It's hard to do well and there's no such thing as permanent perfection.

Declarations of acceptance are passed down from executive conference rooms, by way of internal emails and external job postings. In reality, an inclusive work environment isn’t a box to be checked off, a message to be marked as read, or a motivational poster hung by a water cooler. It takes effort across the board, throughout all levels of a workplace to create a space where everyone feels welcome.\r\n\r\nThere are concrete advantages to an inclusive company culture, including increased productivity, creativity, and collaboration. In industries like design, engineering, technology, and management, those three facets can be the difference between being at the top of your field, or the bottom of the pack, so what employer wouldn’t want every worker to be feeling and performing at their best?\r\n\r\nAs a gay man, I have a personal stake in encouraging each and every company I come in contact with to consider the identity expression of their employees. More specifically, as a gay man in the south, I’ve had plenty of experience working in places that have been less than opening and accepting. In some positions, a portion of my energy that could have otherwise been dedicated to my job, instead went to staying in the “work-closet,” despite my proudly being out to friends and family for years at the time. I caught myself “straightening up” my wardrobe, removing nail polish from my fingers, and changing gender pronouns when coworkers probed about my dating life. From time to time, I’d be extremely conscious of peers that would react negatively if they knew I was gay. Often, I was unsure whether people would care or not. But if it’s not clear whether a company’s culture genuinely supports people of all kinds of identities, it’s consequently easier for people of marginalized communities to suppress who they are to some degree. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until I found a job at a company that champions diversity and personal identity, that I realized I had silently wandered my way back into a closet. Over time, I realized that many of my coworkers had their own closets, even those outside of communities you typically hear about in conversations about inclusivity. They changed the way they spoke, avoided conversations around religious practices and holidays, and removed piercings and covered tattoos with foundation or long sleeves.  Identity concealment had been slipped into morning routines, somewhere between the first cup of coffee and last red light before pulling into the parking lot. \r\n\r\nHistorically, the groups most affected by this are those belonging to marginalized communities. There’s been a long history of discrimination and mistreament on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender expression in the workplace. Although we’ve made great strides forward over the past century by way of workplace equality, we’re still not there. For example, as of 2018, it’s still legal to be fired from your job in 30 states, solely for being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Even if you work for a company in a state with protections, there’s always a level of uncertainty about how people may react to your true identity. In my case, concealment became a defense mechanism. Because of it, I wasn’t at my best. I know that I may just be one single employee, but if every historically marginalized group falls victim to identity concealment at some point or another, the numbers increase exponentially. 4.5% of the US population identifies as queer. 39% identify as a racial or ethnic minority. 51% identify as female. This is a bigger issue than one person, one company, or one state. \r\n\r\nThis talk highlights the opportunities of individual employees at all levels of a company or organization to make their work lives better. Diversity, inclusion, and identity expression can make or break company culture. Shortcomings in diversity diminish productivity, creativity, and collaboration. A lack of consideration of how safe, welcome, and accepted your employees feel can have far reaching consequences, but it’s not just about people feeling comfortable. It’s about making sure that a portion of the energy they could devote to their jobs, doesn’t go to changing the name of the person they’re dating. It doesn’t go towards second guessing conversations with coworkers, or towards prevented conversations in the first place. It’s so that energy, that effort, that focus, can help propel your company and workplace forward with all of your employees fully on board. There are tangible benefits to enacting efforts around identity expression and inclusion at work. Being a diverse and open workplace is just good business. \r\n","tags":"Inclusion, Diversity, LGBTQ, Minorities, Equality, Design, Creativity, Engineering, Teamwork, Culture, Collaboration, Community","level":"Beginner","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.461Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.461Z","presenter":{"name":"Matthew Rogers"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/131.json"},{"id":132,"title":"The Differences and Benefits of Teaching High School Computer Science (WIP Title)","body":"How did you learn to code?

We're all familiar with the most obvious examples, but did you know the Web Platform has been used to create phone applications, games, art, billboards, kiosks, print, television, automobile and appliance interfaces? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll show how pervasive and fundamental the use of web technologies is, and why it's important to protect the commons of the Web Platform. I will present the interesting history of shrewd decisions, happy accidents, struggles and wrong turns that led us to this point.\r\n\r\nThen, we'll take a look at the complex realities of standards work today. How can we tend the Web Platform to keep it flourishing for another 30 years and beyond? What do we need to be prioritizing right now? And how can you get involved from the trenches of web development? \r\n","tags":"web, standardization, community, history, commons","level":"Advanced","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.665Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.665Z","presenter":{"name":"Brian Kardell"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/143.json"},{"id":144,"title":"Humane Tech: Redefining the Relationship with Pervasive Technology","body":"This talk will orient around my efforts to change and re-orient my relationship to technology, with special attention paid to social media, streaming media (i.e., YouTube, Netflix), and tools to measure and assess technology use. My personal experience will be used to segue into personal evaluation of tech use, and how the user/technology relationship can become more complementary, rather than consumptive. It is NOT about quitting one's smartphone, but rather, using technology in a way that enhances, rather than detracts, from daily life. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the talk will include 5 sections:\r\n- Defining and explaining 'humane technology' and why it matters\r\n- An exploration of how different platforms (especially Facebook, Twitter, and Google) use hyper-targeted user data to segment and engage users\r\n- The starting point: an honest look at my own idle smartphone use ... and what prompted me to change\r\n- Tools and data: apps used to measure time spent in different apps, identifying triggers, and physical interventions ('sleeping bag' for phones)\r\n- First-pass efforts: how successful was I? What happened as a result? Where do I/we go from here? \r\n","tags":"humane technology, technology ethics, work-life balance","level":"Beginner","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.680Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.680Z","presenter":{"name":"Leah Jakaitis"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/144.json"},{"id":145,"title":"Mosaic Theory of Information Security","body":"In finance, a concept called mosaic theory says that non-material information in sufficient quantities can be combined to constitute useful information. Investment analysts using this principle combine non-material information to develop significant insights into companies’ upcoming results without verging into insider trading. \r\n\r\nIn other words, a lot of insignificant details, like you might post to social media, can be combined to deduce significant aspects of your or your organization’s private data. In non-financial information security, a similar principle applies. Small divergences from usual patterns can, when combined together, give a competitor or potential attacker hints about your organization’s strategy, upcoming product launches, or your private personal information. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we discuss types of information you want to avoid posting about yourself or watch out for in your organization’s social media postings to avoid unintentional disclosures.\r\n","tags":"information security, mosaic theory, finance, privacy","level":"Beginner","starts_at":null,"ends_at":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.698Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T02:03:26.698Z","presenter":{"name":"Margaret Fero"},"url":"https://codeandsupply.co/event_sessions/145.json"}]
